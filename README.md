### About me 👋

I am a technical and strategic founder/developer experienced in web3, software engineering and building startups over the past 10 years. I operate at the senior software engineer to CTO level depending on the size of the organisation, and am able to develop a company's "zero to one" product.

I founded and grew Ninja Syndicate into a large team of 50+ web3 builders in Australia, focused on developing a platform for Metaverse Gaming.

I'm looking to contribute to cutting edge software projects with cool problems to solve. I look forward to collaborating with a remote-first, technical and engaging team.

### My Achievements 🏆

With the invaluable help of others, I have:

- Launched a token sale generating over 4.5M USD in revenue
- Founded two software companies growing to 50+ staff
- Mentored and trained 15+ full stack software engineers
- Launched a GameFi product with 17k+ community
- Written smart contracts reaching a TVL of $500k USD
- Ran a tech business podcast reaching 100+ episodes


### My skills 🥷

I have programmed against several languages, frameworks and libraries over the past decade, and can pick up new ones quickly.

My current tools of choice are:

- Go
- TypeScript
- React
- Solidity
- Foundry
- Docker/k8s
- Postgresql

The above tools enable a powerful combination of scalability, type safety, maintainability and general purpose programming.
