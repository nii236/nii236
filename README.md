## üëã About me

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4482567/210204039-ecff32ba-bfe3-4b90-83e3-06132de430ec.png">

I am a technical and strategic founder developer experienced in web3, software engineering and building startups over the past 10 years. I operate at the senior software engineer to CTO level depending on the size of the organisation, and am able to develop a company's "zero to one" product.

My web3 origin story started almost ten years ago, when I bartered Bitcoin for malaria tablets (irl) while living in Ghana, West Africa in 2012.

I founded and grew Ninja Syndicate into a large team of 50+ web3 builders in Australia, focused on developing a platform for Metaverse Gaming.

I'm looking to contribute to cutting edge software projects with cool problems to solve. I look forward to collaborating with a remote-first, technical and engaging team.

You can find out more about me on my [personal website](https://jtmn.dev).
